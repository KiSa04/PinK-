# PinK-
Pinterest client for KaiOS

Current Functions:
-> See Pins\n
-> Save Images\n
-> Pinterest AI tracking clicks and shares to get accurate recommendations\n
-> Share Pins\n
-> Send messages\n
-> Read messages and Pins\n

Fixed:
-> With failed login, a redirect was made to a black page (now it prompts the error message and redirects back to login)
-> Bad parsing of urls led to an unefficient code (it now runs much more smoothly, with fewer requests to the API)

ToDo:
-> Create Boards
-> Search Pins
-> Browse users profile
-> Follow Pin Poster
-> See Pin Poster
