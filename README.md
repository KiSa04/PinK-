# PinK-
Pinterest client for KaiOS


Current Functions:


-> See Pins

-> Save Images

-> Pinterest AI tracking clicks and shares to get accurate recommendations

-> Share Pins

-> Send messages

-> Read messages and Pins


Fixed:

-> With failed login, a redirect was made to a black page (now it prompts the error message and redirects back to login)

-> Bad parsing of urls led to an unefficient code (it now runs much more smoothly, with fewer requests to the API)


ToDo:

-> Create Boards
-> Search Pins
-> Browse users profile
-> Follow Pin Poster
-> See Pin Poster
